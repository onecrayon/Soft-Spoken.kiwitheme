Soft Spoken is a theme for the Twitter client [Kiwi](http://kiwi-app.net)
inspired by the minimal speech bubble look of Tweetie.

To install from the Git repository, make sure that this path exists:

    ~/Library/Application Support/Kiwi/

And then run the following commands:

    cd ~/Library/Application Support/Kiwi/
    git clone git://github.com/onecrayon/Soft-Spoken.kiwitheme.git

You may need to restart Kiwi before the theme shows up in the Preferences.

I hope you enjoy the theme! If you dislike something about it and want to
modify your copy, all of the image resources are in the `components` folder
and everything else is defined via simple CSS.

Remember, if you change an image resource you will need to relaunch Kiwi.
If you simply make a change to the CSS, just change to a different theme
in the prefs and then back to Soft Spoken to see your changes. You can also
use the included description page to preview your changes to the basic
tweets in live time.
